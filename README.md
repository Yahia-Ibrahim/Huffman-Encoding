# Huffman Encoding

Java implementation of **Huffman Encoding** for compressing and decompressing files efficiently.

## ðŸ“¦ Overview

This project uses the **Huffman encoding algorithm** to:
- Compress a file by reducing its size using variable-length binary codes for characters.
- Decompress the encoded file back to its original content.

Huffman encoding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns shorter codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent ones.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Encode files using Huffman compression.
- Decode and restore the original file from the compressed output.
- Efficient binary tree-based implementation.
